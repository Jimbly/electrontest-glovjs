Build plan:
  integrate greenworks and try launching a packaged build from Steam, does overlay work, etc?
  exclude .map files (at least from ASAR)

Don't get devtools on ctrl+shift+I if menu is hidden
  - call BrowserWindow.webContents.openDevTools() ourselves, I guess
Need F11 and Alt+Enter hotkeys for fullscreen toggle
Remember fullscreen state between launches
Crash report is putting the product= and version= values on the query parameters instead of part of the post body
  Probably easier to fix simple-breakpad-server for this
Renderer crash is not exiting the app gracefully / showing any status
Icons: https://www.electronforge.io/guides/create-and-add-icons
Alt+F4 hotkey is not going through
Add Alt+Enter hotkey

Probably won't address:
  Server does not reload upon changes
