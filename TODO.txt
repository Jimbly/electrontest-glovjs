Next:

Error reporting for JavaScript errors in the main thread (and preload code?) - error kind makes it to renderer, but doesn't make it to our uncaught exception handler
Figure out why electron is blocking async typescript (maybe only happens before changing electron-dev to not depend on TypeScript?)

Maybe later:
  might need a steamActive() query function?
  steamAvatarForAccount() - needs to hook onPersonaStateChanged()
  crash reports: get error report details into crash reports - need to call crashReporter.addExtraParameter() in _each_ process

Notes:
  Steam init fails if either Steam is not running, or it is but you don't own the product
    Steam in offline mode works fine, but do not get encrypted app tickets for high score submission - maybe should not even query high scores in offline mode
  To be DRM-free, we want this behavior to be _different_ than running the demo, and sure the demo does not fall back into the full game if Steam isn't running!
  Demo build: should share a depot, only have a different steam_appid.txt in the demo-specific depot
